# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **eduweb-db** repository, which contains the schema, API and documentation for the EDU WEB database system. The project manages educational content including courses, modules, lessons, and student progress tracking.

## Repository Status

This repository is currently in initial setup phase with only a README.md file present. The codebase structure, build system, and core functionality are yet to be implemented.

## Development Context

- **Language/Framework**: Not yet determined - no configuration files present
- **Database Schema**: Intended to handle educational content structure (courses → modules → lessons) and progress tracking
- **Purpose**: Database layer for an educational web platform

## Next Steps for Development

When implementing this project, consider:
- Database schema design for hierarchical educational content
- API structure for CRUD operations on courses, modules, lessons
- Progress tracking mechanisms for student advancement
- Documentation generation for database schema and API endpoints
